                <p class="card-text" id="self-study">Self-learning is a powerful skill that empowers individuals to take control of their education and personal growth. By developing self-learning habits, people gain independence and resilience, essential traits for adapting to an ever-changing world. As Mahatma Gandhi once said, "Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever." This quote highlights the endless possibilities of self-driven education, emphasizing that learning should be a lifelong pursuit. Self-learning fosters critical thinking and problem-solving skills. When individuals learn on their own, they have to research, assess information, and make sense of complex topics without constant guidance. This process encourages deeper understanding and a more personalized grasp of knowledge. It also allows learners to progress at their own pace, explore areas of interest, and focus on subjects that align with their passions and career goals.</p>
                <p class="card-text" id="self-study">In addition, self-learning promotes discipline and goal-setting. When people take the initiative to learn independently, they develop a strong sense of responsibility, learning to manage their time and prioritize tasks effectively. This skill is increasingly valuable in today’s workplace, where adaptability and continuous learning are highly valued.</p>
                <p class="card-text" id="self-study">By nurturing self-learning skills, individuals prepare themselves for the challenges and opportunities of the future, creating a foundation for growth that extends beyond formal education.</p>

            <div class="card-body" data-aos="zoom-in-right">
                <p class="card-text" id="group-learning">Group learning fosters collaboration, encourages diverse perspectives, and strengthens problem-solving skills in a way individual study often cannot. When students work in groups, they are exposed to a variety of viewpoints, which deepens their understanding of complex topics and enables them to consider issues from different angles. This collaborative approach also improves communication and teamwork skills—key abilities for both personal growth and professional success. By working together, students are not only able to retain information more effectively but can also clarify any misunderstandings through discussion, feedback, and peer support</p>
                <p class="card-text" id="group-learning">As Albert Einstein famously said, "Learning is not the product of teaching. Learning is the product of the activity of learners." This quote underlines the importance of active engagement in the learning process, which is at the heart of group learning. Through participation, students develop a true understanding of the material, as they’re actively involved rather than passively absorbing information. Group learning also promotes accountability, as each member has a role in the group's success. Knowing that others depend on their contributions instills discipline and confidence. Studies show that students who work in groups often experience increased motivation and enjoyment because they feel a sense of camaraderie and mutual support. This social aspect not only makes learning more enjoyable but also encourages students to strive harder, enhancing their commitment to shared goals.</p>
